This exercise involved several days of work focusing on developing skills in Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, particularly in managing relationships. The task is to create an API called "Jobly" for job searching purposes. Throughout the process, certain objectives and requirements need to be met.

To start, the API should purely handle requests and responses, accepting data from query strings or JSON bodies and consistently returning data in JSON format.

Next, robust authentication and authorization systems need to be set up using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), controlling access to different parts of the API based on specific rules.

Maintaining high code quality is crucial, requiring clear and descriptive naming of functions and variables, along with comprehensive documentation for each function and route. New contributions should also maintain the existing high test coverage, with tests ensuring the correctness of database interactions and API functionality.

Embracing a test-driven development approach is strongly encouraged, where tests are written before implementing new features to streamline development and ensure reliability.

Lastly, participants are encouraged to approach the exercise diligently, staying organized and paying attention to detail while enjoying the process.

In essence, the goal is to build a robust and thoroughly tested API for job searching using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, while following best practices in authentication, code quality, and testing.
